# Harvard Extension Reunion
Welcome to Harvard extension reunion webpage

## About the event
To encourage networking between alumni, cultivate a donor base, and strengthen the community, our mission is to plan and deliver a memorable reunion event for HES alumni.

Primary goals include a successful reunion with thoughtfully determined target participation and a larger fundraising total for the year. Secondary metrics will be the number of online attendees, the split between alumni versus their guests, the creation of a reproducible event template for future gatherings, increased participation in HEAA digital communications like Class Notes and New Feed, and an increased sense of community within the extension school.
